Hi! My name is Vojta Doležal. I am 22 years old Film maker based in Prague, where I also study a University of Creative communication. I dedicated my time to visuals for 7 years and 3 years full-time. I become from a small czech city called Česká Třebová, which is situated in Pardubice region. Currently I spend most of the time in Prague, depending on the amount of work I have to finish.

## A little bit more about Me
- If you don't find me in my room on laptop working, I'm probably at the gym or hanging out with my friends or reading books. I like to keep my actions balanced. So my ideal day has to include work or education (to keep growing mentally), food (to keep the body healthy) and entertainment or relax (to keep my mind healthy). I am very extroverted person so when I meet you for the first time, I will probably tell you 90% of the information about myself. Throughout my entire life I tried many sports, like tennis, table tennis, football, voleyball, MMA (mixed martial arts) and Jiu-Jitsu.
  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu taught me a lot and I got biggest takeaway out of it. This might sound a little bit morbid, but I just loved the science of choking, sparring with my friends and just training in general. My sensei was and is a very tough guy and he taught me to a solid discipline. And that is the main fact that forced me to take my life very seriously and stop being lazy.

- This project I shot for a pretty much famous rapper, who goes by the name "Earth". The main topic of my work was to capture moments and publishable content for promotion of this concrete music video. The shoot itself took us about 23 hours in total, so it was quite exhausting. But we handled it anyways. The topic of the song and music video is descripted by its name "HLUK", which in translation means "loud noise".
  
- Photos created with the relation to the topic of music video, because it teases the artists fans and viewers to stay tuned for the soon outcoming project, because it is important to draw people's attention to a project, because the artist wants to make money out of this project and the revenue is based on the number of views, because he has to make a living somehow.
- My output of this project was about 50 photos made simply as a memory of the day and about 8 photos for a promotional purposes. During the long day of making I realized that when there is passion, the time and tiredness are irrelevant, you just keep going.

  - P3 Logistic Parks opening was a huge gala corporate event, filled with an entertainment program such as cosplay models and rope dance performers. The company celebrated an opening of 44 000 square meters filled with 12 warehouses, which are going to be rented to other huge companies for storage purposes.
  - My job was to capture moments of the fabulous night. So the client has a content for the great news. Because he has to market the company properly, because he has to draw attention of other companies, to actually sell the "product" he provides to rent.
  - My takeaway of this project was a great memory and well spent time with a lot of interesting people.
